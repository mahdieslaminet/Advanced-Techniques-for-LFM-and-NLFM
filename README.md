Detailed Description
Original Articles

The repository includes several original research articles forming the study's foundation:

    Original Article 1: Discusses advanced radar signal processing techniques and their applications in target detection and tracking.
    Original Article 2: Explores the design and implementation of active cancellation systems to mitigate interference in radar systems
Combined Article

The Combined Article synthesizes the findings from the original articles, providing a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in radar signal processing and active cancellation systems. It integrates various methodologies, results, and discussions to present a holistic view of the research area.
Presentation Files

The Presentation file is a PowerPoint presentation summarizing the key points of the combined article. Additionally, the Presentation Video provides a recorded presentation for those who prefer a visual and auditory explanation of the research.
Simulation Files

The simulations/ directory contains MATLAB codes used for the simulations presented in the articles. These files are essential for replicating the experiments and understanding the practical implications of the theoretical concepts discussed in the articles.

    Simulation Code 1: MATLAB code for simulating radar signal processing techniques.
    Simulation Video: A recorded video demonstrating the simulations and their outcomes.

Recorded Presentation Videos

In addition to the presentation slides, the repository includes recorded videos of the presentations:

    Presentation Video: A comprehensive walkthrough of the PowerPoint presentation.
    Simulation Video: A detailed demonstration of the simulation files and their results.
